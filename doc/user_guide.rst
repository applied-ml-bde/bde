System and setup
================

While we strive to make our project open source friendly and available to as many people as possible,
it is currently tested only on windows and we've encountered several issues on linux systems.

Download and setup your repository
----------------------------------

To get our package simply clone our repo from github

.. prompt:: bash $

  git clone https://github.com/applied-ml-bde/bde.git

The simplest way to setup the environment for our package is using `pixi`. 
Simply enter the project directory and install the environment.

.. prompt:: bash $

  cd bde
  pixi install -a --frozen
