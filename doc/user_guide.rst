System and setup
================

While we strive to make our project open source friendly and available to as many people as possible,
it is currently tested only on windows and we've encountered several issues on linux systems.

Setting up the environment

We use pixi to manage our environments.
To quickly install all environemts clone the repo from our githubpage,
open a terminal from its main directory, and run:

```bash
pixi install -a --frozen
```
